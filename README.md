Assignment 3: Hospital Quality 

This assignment will be graded using unit tests executed via the submit script that you run on your computer. To obtain the submit script, run the following code in R:
source("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog%2Fscripts%2Fsubmitscript3.R")

Or you can download the script to your working directory (NOTE: You may need to rename the script to be "submitscript3.R"). Then source it locally via
source("submitscript3.R")

The first time you run the submit script it will prompt you for your Submission login and Submission password. These can be found at the top of the Programming Assignments page. To execute the submit script, type
submit()

Entering a number between 1 and 10 will execute the corresponding part of the homework. We will compare the output of your functions to the correct output. For each test passed you receive the specified number of points on the Assignments List web page.
